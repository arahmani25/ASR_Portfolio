## How Dark Mode Works 🌓

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (Step by Step) 📦

### Option 1: First Time Setup

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Sign up for free

2. **Create a new repository**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name it: `yourusername.github.io` (replace with YOUR GitHub username)
   - Make it **Public**
   - Don't add README or .gitignore (we already have them)

3. **Install dependencies** (in your project folder)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Initialize and push your code**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git
   git init
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit - ASR Portfolio"
   
   # Add your GitHub repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings"
   - Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "gh-pages" branch
   - Click "Save"

7. **Done! 🎉**
   - Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io`
   - It may take 2-3 minutes for the first deployment

### Option 2: Update Your Portfolio Later

When you make changes to your portfolio:

```bash
# Save your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
git push origin main

# Deploy updated version
npm run deploy
```

## Testing Locally 🖥️

Before deploying, you can test locally:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

## Customizing Your Portfolio ✏️

### Change the Logo
File: `/components/Navigation.tsx`
Line 96: Change `ASR` to whatever you want

### Update Your Information
Each section is in its own file in `/components/`:
- `Hero.tsx` - Main landing section
- `About.tsx` - About you section
- `Experience.tsx` - Work experience
- `Education.tsx` - Education history
- `Projects.tsx` - Your projects
- `Skills.tsx` - Your skills
- `Awards.tsx` - Awards and achievements
- `Contact.tsx` - Contact information

### Change Colors
All sections use Tailwind CSS gradient classes:
```tsx
// Purple to blue
bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600

// Green to emerald
bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-500

// Change to any color you like!
```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Dark mode not working?
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Site not loading?
- Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
- Check GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings > Pages
- Verify gh-pages branch exists

### Build errors?
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```
